            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am currently working in the label printing business making sticky labels for a local print
            shop on Capital Hill area of Seattle, Wa.  While I have been there for the past seven years,
            I have been taking higher education classes on a part time basis. I have completed my associates
            degree from Cascadia College and taking more classes on programming languages, which I have been enjoying the 
            challenges of making programs or websites.</p>
            <p>My history in working with HTML goes back about a decade ago, where I was maintaing a few local paintball
            websites.  It has been a big adjustment between HTML 4.xx and HTML 5 that I have noticed from what we have
            covered for the first few classes.</p>
